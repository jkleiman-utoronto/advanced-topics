# Hungary: The Final Solution's Ultimate Target

Hy Abram's testimony touches upon a few integral themes surrounding how the Holocaust unfolded in Hungary. Notably the German invasion and subsequent deportations, the theft of Jewish-owned valuables, and the role that some Hungarians played in victimizing Jews. Scholarly sources are invaluable for developing a quantitative understanding of the Holocaust in totality, but the testimonies of survivors like Abrams help one understand the more intangible aspects of how the Holocaust unfolded in specific communities. Above all, Abrams illustrates how chaotic Hungary was in 1944, and the fear that pervaded the Jewish population as they tried desperately to avoid capture and deportation.
