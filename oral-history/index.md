&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing the Holocaust in Hungary requires an understanding of the historical context that preceded the German invasion of Hungary in 1944. The position of Hungarian Jews in the 1940s is unique, primarily because they lived in a country that was an ally of Nazi Germany, as Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact in 1940. [(Archives.gov)](https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/finding-aid/civilian/rg-84-hungary.html) This made the legal status of Hungarian Jews distinct from those of most other large European Jewish populations, who lived in territories that would come under direct German military occupation, such as Poland or northern France. [(Jewish Virtual Library)](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-population-of-europe-before-the-holocaust-map) Hungarian Jews still experienced anti-Semitism, as it had been legally enshrined.[(Don, 65-73)](https://www-jstor-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/4467318?seq=11#metadata_info_tab_contents) Moreover, many Hungarian Jews were forced into labour before 1944, of which roughly 23,000 died.[(Yad-Vashem)](https://www.yadvashem.org/articles/general/conscripted-slaves-hungarian-jewish-forced-laborers.html) However, until 1944, Hungarian Jews, save for the ones in Hungarian-occupied territory in Slovakia, Ukraine and Serbia, were not deported to the death camps in Poland.[(Farkas)](https://thecjn.ca/arts/books-and-authors/how-it-happened-examines-the-holocaust-in-hungary/). This all changed after the German invasion of Hungary, which as Abrams notes, happened before Pesach (Passover), 1944. (Abrams, 0:00-0:08). Germany invaded Hungary over concerns that Miklos Horthy's government was attempting to seek a separate peace with the allies, and in the 7 days following the 12th of March, 1944, the German army had occupied the entire country. [(Ránki, 267-273)](https://www-jstor-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/42554767?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) The German occupation now meant that the Germans had direct access to the largest European Jewish population that had hitherto evaded deportations.  In his testimony, Abrams briefly details the steps that the new German occupying forces took to carry out the destruction of Hungarian Jewry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Abrams corroborates in his testimony, the majority of the Jewish population of Hungary was rounded up following Operation Margarethe, and where thereafter deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. (Abrams, 0:32-0:40) By the end of the summer of 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, of which 397,000 were killed in the gas chambers. [(Jewish Virtual Library)](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/theodor-dannecker) As Abrams mentions, the roundups and deportations were largely organized by Theodor Dannecker, who acted as Eichmann's subordinate in carrying out the Final Solution in Hungary. Abrams speaks about how these roundups were organized in his own town, where the Jewish population was asked to assemble in a schoolyard. (Abrams, 0:38-0:48) The reason Abrams lived to give his testimony, was because of the fact that his father refused to join the other Jews who had assembled in the schoolyard, and instead quickly fled to a town in the Carpathian mountains. (Abrams, 0:48-0:55) Abrams' interview exemplifies how useful oral testimony can be for historians, as his testimony records not only how deportations were organized in Hungarian communities, but also how Abrams managed to avoid them, providing background for how he lived to see the end of the war, and give an interview 50 years later in Brooklyn. Abrams' story provides a small silver lining for what was an incredibly grim period of history, and miraculously, a select few Hungarian Jews similarly managed to narrowly avoid death. There were numerous efforts to save the Hungarian Jewish population, including the controversial 'Kastner Train', where 1200 Jews were transported to Switzerland, after an agreement was reached between the Hungarian Jew Rudolf Kastner, and Adolf Eichmann. [(Holden)](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23killing.html) Much less controversial were the actions of the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who managed to save the lives of 100,000 Hungarian Jews by hiding them in buildings in Budapest that were declared extraterritorial Swedish land. [(UMichigan)](http://wallenberg.umich.edu/raoul-wallenberg/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike in the aforementioned rescue efforts, Abrams escaped deportation solely through the efforts of his father. Despite escaping deportation, Abrams and his family remained in an incredibly dangerous situation, and were nearly killed (Abrams, 1:55-2:05). Abrams' father took him to an unnamed town in the Carpathians, and the scene which Abrams' witnessed there was at the same time chilling, yet typical of the wartime situation of European Jews. Abrams sees two young girls run to the town's school, with bloody ears. He soon finds out that they had their golden earrings torn off of their ears by a local Hungarian man, Anton. (Abrams,2:30-2:47) Abrams testimony deals with an issue that has been widely discussed in scholarship surrounding the Holocaust: the theft of Jewish valuables and jewelry by both German and local actors. Abrams discusses how this occured in one isolated incident, but theft of Jewish gold occurred all throughout Europe during the war. One recent study estimates that the value of stolen Jewish gold — which the German government deposited in Swiss banks — was roughly 146 million US dollars, adjusting this figure for inflation brings it to 2.2 billion dollars. [(Cowell)](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/02/world/swiss-say-nazis-stole-more-victim-gold-than-believed.html) From Abrams' account, it does not seem that Anton was a collaborator in the traditional sense, as he is not shown working directly for the German authorities. Rather, Anton heartlessly took advantage of the situation at hand to enrich himself. The blurred lines between collaboration and opportunism evident in Abrams' story present themselves in a variety of different contexts. Perhaps the most infamous example, albeit one after the war, was the 1946 pogrom in Kielce, Poland, where Jewish refugees who had returned to their pre-war homes were blood libeled and killed. [(Gross)](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/kielce-post-holocaust-pogrom-poland-still-fighting-over-180967681/) Abrams' testimony thus touches upon the incredibly important issue of local complicity in the oppression and victimization of Jews.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Abrams' testimony is a great example of the valuable role that oral history can play in offering qualitative, tangible evidence that improves and contextualizes historical understanding. The clip discussed is only three minutes, but the interview's total length runs well over an hour and a half. In the clip Abrams recounts his own experiences in the spring and summer of 1944, but in doing so he also recounts the experiences of thousands of other Jews who sadly could not live to give their own testimonies. Despite the abundance of concrete historical evidence that the digital age grants humanity access to, historical revionism and denialism surrounding the Holocaust sadly remains prevalent. There are thousands of survivors who remain to tell their tales (my own grandfather being one of them), but one day these survivors will no longer be physically present to tell their stories. It is because of this inescapable truth that the conduction and recording of historical interviews such as that of Abrams must continue, not only in the context of the Holocaust, but for other historical atrocities and events as well.
