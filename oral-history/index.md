Analyzing the Holocaust in Hungary requires an understanding of the historical context that preceded the German invasion of Hungary in 1944. The position of Hungarian Jews in the 1940s is unique, primarily because they lived in a country that was an ally of Nazi Germany, as Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact in 1940. [(Archives.gov)](https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/finding-aid/civilian/rg-84-hungary.html) This made the legal status of Hungarian Jews distinct from those of most other large European Jewish populations, who lived in territories that would come under direct German military occupation, such as Poland or northern France. [(Jewish Virtual Library)](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-population-of-europe-before-the-holocaust-map) Hungarian Jews still experienced anti-semitism, as it had been legally enshrined.[(Don, 65-73)](https://www-jstor-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/4467318?seq=11#metadata_info_tab_contents) Moreover, many Hungarian Jews were forced into labour before 1944, of which roughly 23,000 died.[(Yad-Vashem)](https://www.yadvashem.org/articles/general/conscripted-slaves-hungarian-jewish-forced-laborers.html) However, until 1944, Hungarian Jews, save for the ones in Hungarian-occupied territory in Slovakia, Ukraine and Serbia, were not deported to the death camps in Poland.[(Farkas)](https://thecjn.ca/arts/books-and-authors/how-it-happened-examines-the-holocaust-in-hungary/). This all changed after the German invasion of Hungary, which as Abrams notes, happened before Pesach (Passover), 1944. (Abrams, 0:00-0:08). Germany invaded Hungary over concerns that Miklos Horthy's government was attempting to seek a seperate peace with the allies, and in the 7 days following the 12th of March, 1944, the German army had occupied the entire country. [(RÃ¡nki, 267-273)](https://www-jstor-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/42554767?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) The German occupation now meant that the Germans had direct access to the largest European Jewish population that had hitherto evaded deportations.  In his testimony, Abrams briefly details the steps that the new German occupying forces took to carry out the destruction of Hungarian Jewry.
