# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our application for the generous yet humble Student Development Grant, our team proposes the creation of a new interactive digital model of the Antikythera mechanism, one that will be publicly accessible online. Since the discovery of the mechanism in a shipwreck near Rhodes in 1900, the Antikythera device has fascinated archaeologists, classicists and astronomers alike, due to both its complexity, and its peculiar position in the historical record.[(De Solla Price, 67)]("https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006146?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=antikythera+mechanism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dantikythera%2Bmechanism%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6168%2Ftest&refreqid=fastly-default%3Aaf25da3fc13cf807908ab90c22e38213&seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents") The mechanism has been described either as an analog computer or calculator, and is the oldest such device yet to be discovered. [(Lobell, 44)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41780223?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=antikythera+mechanism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dantikythera%2Bmechanism%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6168%2Ftest&refreqid=fastly-default%3Af62f4659066b86e8882256c69794fd91&seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents) The full capabilities that the device possessed are not fully understood, but X-ray analyses of the various fragments from the archaeological dig, as well as an analysis of the inscriptions therein, have demonstrated that the device tracked the motion of the some or all of the planets known to ancient Greek astronomers. [(Freeth et. al)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w) Moreover, the device could predict the date of future solar and lunar eclipses, as well as display to its user the date of the next Olympic games. The device also functioned as a simple calendar, telling the user the current date. Since the mechanism's discovery, a number of models and simulations of the mechanism have been created. As the understanding of the mechanism's function and construction has evolved — primarily through continued analysis of the numerous fragments of the original archaeological find, as well as the discovery of new fragments near the original site — the complexity and accuracy of these models has similarly evolved. By the 1970s, Dr. Derek J. de Solla Price was the first to create a complete model of the device, though this initial model accounted solely for the mechanism's simulation of the Sun and Moon, as de Solla did not know that the mechanism also contained axles which modelled the rotations of planets, nor did he know that the mechanism could predict the date of eclipses. [(de Solla, 22 & 40)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006146?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=antikythera+mechanism&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dantikythera%2Bmechanism%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6168%2Ftest&refreqid=fastly-default%3Aaf25da3fc13cf807908ab90c22e38213&seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents). In 2008, Tony Freeth from the University College, London, and a team of other researchers, discovered the mechanism's ability to track eclipses and calculate the date of  upcoming Olympiads, greatly increasing understanding of the device's complexity when compared to de Solla's original model.[(Freeth et. al, 5)](https://web.archive.org/web/20130927141324/http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/system/files/Antikythera_Nature2008_submitted.pdf). The most recently developed model (now a digital render), was developed in March 2021, also by Freeth and a team of researchers, using new CT scans and inscriptionary analysis. It was only after this recent research that the device's ability to track the position of all 5 non-Earth planets known to the Ancient Greeks, was discovered.[(Freeth et. al)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w). Our team hopes to build upon the works of all these great researchers, not by conducting new research of the fragmentary mechanism itself, but by creating a digital interactive model of the mechanism that incorporates de Solla and Freeth's findings. Physical models of the mechanism built off of de Solla's original findings have been created, but the novel discoveries of Freeth's team have only been displayed in the team’s own static digital renderings. Additionally, a [digital simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFJqjCEFco4) was created by Ioannis S. Diolatzis, a PhD candidate from the University of Patras, but this simulation was made in 2017, and thus does not include the functions discovered by Freeth's team in 2021. Our new digital model will incorporate the findings of Freeth's team, will be publicly available, and will also serve as a useful educational tool, because it will display English translations of the mechanism's various Greek inscriptions and will also provide explanations of the specific astronomical phenonomena that the mechanism displays/predicts.
