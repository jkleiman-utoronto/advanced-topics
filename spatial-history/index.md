# <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[9])">Hadrian's Wall</a>

<a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[9])">Hadrian's Wall</a> is perhaps the most culturally recognizable Roman line of fortification. The greatest testament to the wall's impressiveness in a purely architectural sense, is the fact that so much of it still stands <a href="https://hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/hadrians-wall/hadrian’s-wall-facts">today</a>. The wall ran 80 Roman miles length-wise, and was originally fifteen feet high.[(Pham, p. 32)](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8056&context=etd_theses) Along the wall ran a series of forts, each containing its own military garrison. Some of these forts actually predated the construction of the wall itself, and Emperor Hadrian construction of the wall sought to connect these pre-existing forts, as well as add an additional layer of defence.[(Pham, p.30)](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8056&context=etd_theses) The later Antonine Wall, which was built to the north of Hadrian's, in modern Scotland, ran along a much shorter length. The reason Hadrian's Wall was not built along this shorter Northern line, was that it lacked the natural defensive boundaries that existed in the area where Hadrian's Wall was to be built. Whin Sill is a collection of hills in modern-day Northumberland which Hadrian's Wall traversed, the hills had high vertical cliffs that represented a formidable natural barrier for any would-be attacker [(Pham, p.31)](https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8056&context=etd_theses). The manner in which Hadrian's Wall ran through the Whin Sill hills, demonstrates that Roman strategists made good use of natural geographical features to bolster their defensive fortifications, even in cases where these fortifications were largely man-made. By contrast the Antonine Wall was less easily defendable, and Roman forces abandoned the wall in 158 AD, a mere 16 years after its construction. [(Maldonado)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/britannia/article/early-medieval-antonine-wall/22CD176D606D0022A823AB7035D215FD). The desire to take an ever-increasing amount of territory, actually facilitated Roman losses, and forced them to fallback to a more secure line of fortification. This theme of imperial overreach, followed by a retreat to natural or semi-natural defensive barriers, is a common motif of Roman history in this period.


# <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[10])">The <i>Limes Germanicus</i></a>

Similar acts of imperial overreach pitted Roman legions against Germanic tribes in the <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[53]._layers[4])">Teutoburg Forest</a> in 9 AD. [(Lendering)](https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/teutoburg-forest-9-ce/) The slaughter of three Roman legions in the battle that ensued, as well as the capture of the symbolically important standards of these legions, influenced Roman strategy vis a vis Germania for centuries. Save for the brutal punitive expeditions that followed the Roman defeat, which managed to retrieve the lost standards, the Roman Empire largely fell back to a defensive position along the Rhine (the <i>Rhaetian Limes</i>), and other natural barriers.[(Dio, p. 359)](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html) The Rhine was an easily defensible border for a few different reasons. The River's average width is 400 metres [(All German)](http://www.allgerman.com/rhine.htm), and it has a fast current that makes it difficult to traverse [Köln](https://www.stadt-koeln.de/artikel/64430/index.html). Similar to Hadrian's Wall, Roman forts lined much of the Rhine river, and served as defensive outposts. [(UNESCO)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430) Roman cities like <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[49]._layers[2])">Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium</a> also lined the river. Colonia had a population of roughly 25,000 people, and was an important transit point for military supplies headed to soldiers on the frontiers.[(Lendering)](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/colonia-claudia-ara-agrippinensium-koln/) Despite the formidable barrier that the Rhine presented, it was eventually crossed by a number of different tribes in 406 AD.[(Heather)](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/261435/pdf) Gibbon hypothesized that this may have been because the Rhine froze over. The Roman frontier along the <i>Limes Germanicus</i> did not only serve a military purpose, as they also allowed the empire to control trade across the border, and represented a secure area in which Roman settlements could flourish. [(UNESCO)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430)

# <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[11])">The Danubian <i>Limes</i></a>

The Danube similary functioned as a natural barrier along which the Roman Empire could create a defensive frontier. The theme of imperial overreach yet again presents itself in the context Roman actions across the Danube. The province of Dacia (largely situated in modern-day Romania) was abandoned because of the difficulty that the Romans had in defending it from native Dacian tribes.[(Moisil, p. 79)](https://journals.openedition.org/histoiremesure/884). Beyond simply acting as a barrier, the Danube also offered a convenient method for Romans to supply military garrisons along the frontiers with riverboats[(UNESCO)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6475/). In the Danubian delta, where Romans had to choose which tributaries to place their fortifications on, forts were placed in the areas highest in elevation. [(UNESCO)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6475/)  Once again, the Romans effectively used both the course of the river, as well as the surrounding topology, to create easily defendable defensive lines. Prior to the abandoment of Dacia, Emperor Trajan created a gargantuan <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[49]._layers[3])">bridge</a> that spanned the Danube. The bridge was over 1000 metres in length. [(ICPDR)](https://www.icpdr.org/main/publications/danube-watch-2-2018-rediscovering-trajans-bridge-over-danube) Unfortunately, the bridge was demolished by the Emperor Aurelian following the abandonment of Dacia. [(ICPDR)](https://www.icpdr.org/main/publications/danube-watch-2-2018-rediscovering-trajans-bridge-over-danube) This exemplifies the repercussions that Roman overextension could bring, as the Roman Empire had to abandon a monumental architectural project that it had earlier invested time and money into.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Roman Empire created its extensive network of defensive frontiers by making use of the pre-exesting geographical features present in the area. For a very long time, these defenses proved highly effective, but Roman incursions into lands beyond the frontiers were often unsuccessful and costly. Hadrian's Wall, the Rhine and the Danube, all helped prevent invasions into the Roman Empire's territory, and the three military campaigns that extended beyond these lines failed, though some of these failures were more quickly realized than others. Despite the effectiveness of these defensive fortifications, Rome nevertheless fell. A crumbling economy, coupled with an increasingly ineffective military, eventually led to all of these three fortifications being crossed by the very groups that they were meant to keep out. Regardless, these fortifications were still instrumental in keeping the dream that was Rome alive for an exceptionally long time.
