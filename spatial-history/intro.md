# The Roman Empire's Frontiers: Imperial Overreach and Natural Redoubts

Using the most conservative definitions, the Roman Empire lasted for roughly five centuries. Roman civilization and self-rule, on the other hand, lasted for more than a millennium. Despite the length of Roman rule, from 390 BC to 410 AD — a period of nearly eight centuries — <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[49]._layers[1])"> Rome</a> itself was never successfully captured by the army of any foreign adversary. [(Nufellen)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-studies/article/not-much-happened-410-and-all-that/56ACF6095892EB5EBE0DAD0F5EDCFBF6) In this paper, I will argue that the Roman strategy of fortified forward defences — bolstered through a combination of ingenious engineering feats and a utilization of natural geographical features — was instrumental in maintaining this impressively long period of military security. Furthermore, I will argue that Roman military defeats from the first through fifth century often arose from crossing these forward defenses, and attempting to extend Roman control to territories that offered few naturally defensible barriers. I will focus specifically on three crucial fortifications: <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[9])">Hadrian's Wall</a>, <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[10])"> The *Limes Germanicus*, </a> and the <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[59]._layers[11])">*Danubian Limes*</a>.
